# SafeBox Security

SafeBox is built with security as its top priority. Here’s how your data is protected:

## Encryption
- All credentials and notes are encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms before being saved to disk.
- Each user’s data is protected with a unique encryption key derived from their password.

## Secure Authentication
- User registration and login require a strong password.
- Passwords are never stored in plain text.

## Data Isolation
- Each user’s data is stored separately, ensuring privacy and isolation.

## Application Security
- Sensitive operations (like password changes) require authentication.
- Session management ensures users are logged out after inactivity.

## No Cloud Storage
- All data is stored locally on your device. SafeBox does not transmit your credentials or notes to any external server.

## Regular Updates
- SafeBox is regularly updated to address new security threats and vulnerabilities.

## Security Best Practices
- Always use a strong, unique password for your account.
- Do not share your credentials or notes with anyone.
- Log out when you are finished using SafeBox.

## Reporting Issues
- If you discover a security issue, please contact support immediately.
