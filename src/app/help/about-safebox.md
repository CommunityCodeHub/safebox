# SafeBox

In today's world, password requirements are becoming increasingly stringent and difficult to manage. To ensure your security, follow these key guidelines:

1. **Never share your passwords** or store them as plain text files or documents on your computer or any cloud storage. If your device or cloud account is compromised, your accounts could be at risk.
  
2. **Avoid reusing passwords** across multiple accounts. Always use unique passwords for each one.

3. **Make your passwords strong.** The longer, the better. Aim for passwords that are at least 8-16 characters long, including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

4. **Create passwords that are hard to guess, but easy to remember.**

Point #4 is often the most challenging—managing multiple accounts for email, social media, and banking makes remembering unique passwords for each one nearly impossible without violating the above rules.

A password manager is one solution to this issue, but can we trust these apps with our sensitive data, like banking and social media credentials?

## SafeBox: The Solution

This is where **SafeBox** steps in. With SafeBox, you can securely encrypt and store your credentials, including sensitive information like passwords, on your local hard drive or preferrably folder in your computer which is mapped with your cloud storage like onedrive, google drive, or any other cloud storage of your choice. 
SafeBox is designed to handle the encryption and decryption of data you store on your devices or cloud, ensuring everything remains within your control. SafeBox doesn't stores your data outside your machine boundary and hence it has no visibility on your data. **SafeBox does not store your data outside your device, ensuring it has no access or visibility to your information.**

It’s built with **Electron**, **React**, and **Material UI**, offering robust encryption, an intuitive interface, and advanced features for managing personal credentials safely.
